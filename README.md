# infusImport
A module that accepts a CSV file of data that is not easily imported and imports it appropriatly. 

Largely created to import a set of products with options, variable pricing, as well as images. 
This will perform all of the work that it can through the API, however it uses selenium to drive the browser and complete the image upload.
